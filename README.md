# Video Retrieval System with Image Embeddings and RAG
**Overview** 
This project introduces an advanced video retrieval system that efficiently processes and indexes video content for rapid and precise search queries. The system integrates keyframe extraction, object detection, and multimodal embeddings to enhance video retrieval capabilities. Users can retrieve relevant video moments using textual descriptions, images, or metadata-based queries. The backend is implemented in Python with deep learning models for content processing, while the frontend offers an intuitive interface for seamless user interactions. 

To set up the environment, follow the installation steps for both frontend and backend, ensuring GPU availability for optimal performance.
